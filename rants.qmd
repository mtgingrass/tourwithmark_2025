The Fork was a completely tone deaf offer that could only be devised by someone who has never had to actually worry about having a real job.

Normal people can't just lock themselves into unemployment with 2 weeks to decide without something else lined up already. That's not how the real world works for people who need income to feed their kids and pay their mortgage.

I Called My Reps—And You Should Too

Today, I finally did it. I picked up the phone, dialed the numbers for my House Representative and both U.S. Senators from South Carolina, and I let them have it. 

Not about the *return to office* mandate itself—I get it, mandates come from above. But what infuriates me is the absolute lack of **clarity, formal guidance, and answers** for those of us being forced into a decision that impacts **our lives, our families, and our futures**. 

Here’s what I told them:

- **Where’s the official guidance?**  
  It’s all rumors, speculation, and chaos. No one knows what’s happening. If you’re going to upend people’s lives, at least have the decency to put it in writing.  

- **What about relocation pay?**  
  Are they going to help people move? Cover expenses? Do we just eat the cost of uprooting our lives because some bureaucrat made a decision on a whim?  

- **What about locality pay?**  
  If I’ve been working remotely from South Carolina but they now force me to move to D.C. (or elsewhere), does my pay adjust? Am I expected to take a financial hit on top of everything else?  

- **Why the hell are you doing this without a plan?**  
  If I have to relocate, I need notice. If I stay, I need to know what happens next. Will I get severance? Will I be allowed to stay in my role remotely? Or am I just expected to twist in the wind while the people making these decisions keep collecting their paychecks?  

None of these questions have been answered. None of them. And that’s unacceptable.  

So yeah, I called. I made my voice heard. And if you’re in the same boat, **you should call too**. Because sitting around waiting for guidance that may never come is a surefire way to get screwed over. 

If they want to rip people out of their homes, they need to own up to the consequences. I’m not letting this slide.

I deleted my social media. No more doomscrolling, no more endless feeds designed to keep me consuming mindelss media. I don’t need it. I don’t want it. 

Instead, I built this website. No algorithms, no chasing likes—just me, writing what I want, when I want. I know I have no audience. That’s fine. This is for me. 

But I’m not just writing. I’m moving. I’m going to the gym. I’m biking. I’m hiking. I’m living. Because I don’t want to just consume—I want to **do**. 

This is my life. And I’m taking control of it. 

So, if you’re reading this, ask yourself: are you consuming, or are you doing?

Elon is neither a data scientist nor a data engineer. I’m not one either, but I work with data, and the number one rule is that you cannot draw conclusions from data you don’t fully understand.

- What is the definition of each field in the table?

- How was the data collected and processed?

- What does a blank field represent—missing data or an intentional omission?

- Are there established rules for interpretation (e.g., assuming individuals over 120 years old are deceased)?

- Is this dataset even the authoritative source of truth for these records?

- What happens if states no longer report deaths, or if reporting errors come from state agencies rather than the federal government?

- Is this data cross-referenced with benefits records?

- What SQL Statement did his young adult entourage use to query this anyway?

A screenshot of this table, without context or analysis, serves only as propaganda, pitting working-class Americans in the private sector against those in the public sector. It distracts from more pressing issues, such as changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the lucrative government contracts Elon’s companies receive, and the broader oligarchic takeover.

No serious data professional would take that screenshot at face value.

Just realized that trying to automate rants was more trouble than it was worth.  
Back to manual updates for a few days.

This is my first rant! Netlify Identity was a pain, but I figured out a better way.
