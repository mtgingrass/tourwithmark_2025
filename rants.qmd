Powell doesn't single-handedly decide rates as he wants. It's a committee and he's the chair, not a dictator.

Trump can't conceive of any process that involves checks and balances because he thinks like a dictator and all such process is simply an impediment. So he attempts to dismantle anything that stands in his way. He believes one person should run the country (him), forever, and any objection is treason. He has said so clearly many times.

Theft by employers through stolen wages exceed all other forms of theft combined.
Mugging, burglary, shoplifting. All less than stolen by employers from employees.
And yet, if an employee takes a  out of the register, the cops will arrest them and throw them in a jail cell, when a kid decided to back out of selling their goat too the the fair because she loved it and wanted to keep it as a pet, the cops travelled 500 miles, took the goat, and had it slaughtered. (https://reason.com/2023/03/31/police-traveled-500-miles-to-seize-girls-pet-goat-for-slaughter/)
But call the cops about an employer keeping thousands of dollars of your pay? Uh, thats a civil issue." Notice how its only a crime if its the poor stealing from the rich.
Thanks for what you do at the DOL. Its too bad the conservatives have been dismantling so much of the federal DOL.

It's not the strangers/drag queens/LGBTQ people that you, or especially kids, need to worry about. It's the men in the family. After working 11 years at a crime lab doing DNA, I don't know if I've come across a kid rape kit with a trans person as the suspect. But there are thousands of them from the dad/stepdad/moms bf/step brother/grandpa/etc. If you want to protect kids, start there.

So, bathroom bills aren't really protecting kids, just diverting attention from actually threats.

This entire rant is from From [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j0zud0/comment/mfgi38j/) user [**JustMyOpinionz**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JustMyOpinionz/) . This deserves to be read:

The Oval Office meeting between Trump, Vance, and Zelensky was not just a failure of diplomacy. It was not just an insult to an ally. It was treason.

What happened in that room was an act of groveling submission to authoritarianism, a moment in which the so-called "leaders" of America turned their backs on the very values this nation was founded upon. Trump and Vance did not speak to Zelensky as allies, nor as partners in democracy. They spoke to him as cowards who have already surrendered.

Trump and Vance are not America. They are a disgrace to America. They are a stain on the very soul of this nation. They are the embodiment of every failure, every betrayal, every moment of weakness that has allowed tyranny to flourish. They are not defenders of democracy; they are its executioners.

And yet, while Trump cowers before dictators and sells out his own allies, while Vance parrots the talking points of autocrats, while American democracy fights through its darkest hour, there is one man who stands where they have fallen.

Zelensky.

Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine, is the true leader of the free world.

Not Trump. Not Vance. Not the billionaires. Not the cowards and appeasers who think that democracy can be traded away for temporary comfort.

Zelensky is the last man standing in the face of authoritarian aggression.

He does not have billions of dollars in stolen wealth propping him up. He does not have a state-controlled propaganda machine rewriting history on his behalf. What he has is courage. What he has is a spine. What he has is a commitment to democracy that puts every so-called leader in the West to shame.

Trump and Vance? They are frauds. They are weaklings who would rather kneel before tyrants than fight for what is right.

But Zelensky? He stands.

While Trump schemes, Zelensky fights. While Vance panders, Zelensky leads. While America stumbles, Zelensky holds the line.

The Fork was a completely tone deaf offer that could only be devised by someone who has never had to actually worry about having a real job.

Normal people can't just lock themselves into unemployment with 2 weeks to decide without something else lined up already. That's not how the real world works for people who need income to feed their kids and pay their mortgage.

I Called My Reps—And You Should Too

Today, I finally did it. I picked up the phone, dialed the numbers for my House Representative and both U.S. Senators from South Carolina, and I let them have it.

Not about the *return to office* mandate itself—I get it, mandates come from above. But what infuriates me is the absolute lack of **clarity, formal guidance, and answers** for those of us being forced into a decision that impacts **our lives, our families, and our futures**.

Here's what I told them:

-   **Where's the official guidance?**  
    It's all rumors, speculation, and chaos. No one knows what's happening. If you're going to upend people's lives, at least have the decency to put it in writing.

-   **What about relocation pay?**  
    Are they going to help people move? Cover expenses? Do we just eat the cost of uprooting our lives because some bureaucrat made a decision on a whim?

-   **What about locality pay?**  
    If I've been working remotely from South Carolina but they now force me to move to D.C. (or elsewhere), does my pay adjust? Am I expected to take a financial hit on top of everything else?

-   **Why the hell are you doing this without a plan?**  
    If I have to relocate, I need notice. If I stay, I need to know what happens next. Will I get severance? Will I be allowed to stay in my role remotely? Or am I just expected to twist in the wind while the people making these decisions keep collecting their paychecks?

None of these questions have been answered. None of them. And that's unacceptable.

So yeah, I called. I made my voice heard. And if you're in the same boat, **you should call too**. Because sitting around waiting for guidance that may never come is a surefire way to get screwed over.

If they want to rip people out of their homes, they need to own up to the consequences. I'm not letting this slide.

I deleted my social media. No more doomscrolling, no more endless feeds designed to keep me consuming mindelss media. I don't need it. I don't want it.

Instead, I built this website. No algorithms, no chasing likes—just me, writing what I want, when I want. I know I have no audience. That's fine. This is for me.

But I'm not just writing. I'm moving. I'm going to the gym. I'm biking. I'm hiking. I'm living. Because I don't want to just consume—I want to **do**.

This is my life. And I'm taking control of it.

So, if you're reading this, ask yourself: are you consuming, or are you doing?

Elon is neither a data scientist nor a data engineer. I'm not one either, but I work with data, and the number one rule is that you cannot draw conclusions from data you don't fully understand.

-   What is the definition of each field in the table?

-   How was the data collected and processed?

-   What does a blank field represent—missing data or an intentional omission?

-   Are there established rules for interpretation (e.g., assuming individuals over 120 years old are deceased)?

-   Is this dataset even the authoritative source of truth for these records?

-   What happens if states no longer report deaths, or if reporting errors come from state agencies rather than the federal government?

-   Is this data cross-referenced with benefits records?

-   What SQL Statement did his young adult entourage use to query this anyway?

A screenshot of this table, without context or analysis, serves only as propaganda, pitting working-class Americans in the private sector against those in the public sector. It distracts from more pressing issues, such as changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the lucrative government contracts Elon's companies receive, and the broader oligarchic takeover.

No serious data professional would take that screenshot at face value.
