description: "The government is setting itself up for failure by replacing experienced workers with less capable ones, all while pushing rigid return-to-office policies that drive talent away. If they don’t value long-term institutional knowledge, federal jobs will become nothing more than short-term stepping stones, leading to a revolving door of inexperience. In the end, they’ll realize too late that cutting seasoned professionals only weakens the system—but by then, the damage will be done."

# Getting Reduction in Forced Out

I’ve accepted that I might get RIF’d from the government. At first, of course, it’s stressful—you’re constantly dwelling on how you’re going to survive, how you’re going to live. But over time, it becomes normalized. Once that happens, you reach acceptance.

What I’ve realized is that I’m an exceptional worker. Sure, I have lazy days. Some days I’m more productive than others. That happens to everyone—in the office, out of the office, private sector, public sector. Even Congress and elected officials have days where they’re either beneficial or completely useless. It’s human nature. You only live once, and I’m in my 40s thinking, *Do I really want a stressful life for the next 25 or 30 years?*

If they don’t accept me for who I am, that’s their problem. When they replace me, which they will, they’re going to get someone not as good. And it’ll happen again and again. The next person won’t necessarily be better. They need to realize that *I* am the norm. And if they hire me, they’re getting a damn good worker. The problem is that they’re replacing us with *worse* workers. Let’s not overthink this—the world is average. That’s why averages exist. I feel like I’m a little above average. Of course, probably everyone thinks that. But when they replace me, they’ll likely get someone *below* average. That’s my theory. Could I be wrong? Sure. But that’s how I see it.

You can’t have the top 20% without a bottom 20%. This isn’t Jack Welch 101. If they start cutting people from the top, they’re just making the bottom bigger.

And let’s talk about retention. All these miserable employees dealing with RTO—return to office—they think it’s expensive to maintain buildings, provide toilet paper, and handle lawsuits when someone stubs their toe on a loose stair. Just wait. It’s going to get worse. People will leave in droves for remote work. And when they do, all that training and institutional knowledge will walk out the door with them.

It’ll take *years* to rebuild that experience—if it ever happens. The government might stop being a long-term career move altogether. It could become a temporary stop: *I’ll stay in government for a couple of years until I find something better.* That long-term, 15- to 20-year experience—where people understand strategic planning, downstream effects, and complex systems—will disappear. Sure, not *everyone* needs that kind of experience, but some do. And that’s exactly what they’re getting rid of.
