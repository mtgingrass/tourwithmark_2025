## Live in this Van on Day One!

Everything is functional with top-tier components. If you know vanlife gear, you'll recognize the names: Victron, Battle Born, Webasto, Velit, MaxxAir, Unaka, Scopema.

The cost of the components ($20k estimate) is only half the battle. It's the time saved ordering and waiting for backorders for parts. Many of these parts have months-long lead times. With this van, it's already installed, wired, and ready to hit the road.

All of the costs are estimates based off memory, do your homework and check. I'm probablay fairly close though. Either way, it's a good deal if you ask me.

## Vehicle Details

- 163k highway miles, runs excellent
- Extended wheelbase + high roof = maximum living space, full stand-up height
- Paint/cosmetics fair condition (functional but not showroom)
- Clean title (with USAA bank) — we'll handle payoff + transfer through USAA for a safe sale. 

USAA considers this van a normal van. I did not insure it for a camper van. Just an FYI.
