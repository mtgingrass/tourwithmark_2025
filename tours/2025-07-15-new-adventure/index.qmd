# Racing the Rain

I thought I could beat the rain on my CRF300L. I was wrong! At least it turned into my first rain riding experience, and it was pretty refreshing.

As I walked to my dual sport, I saw the cluds and thought I could make a quick ride to the gym, beat the storm, stay dry. Mother Nature had other plans.

## First Time in the Rain

This was my first time riding in the rain. Visibility was pretty bad. The rain was hitting  my face and my sunglasses. It felt good though. Very refreshging.

I still made it to the gym. I half assed it, but I made it.
