# Wild Fires

Just wrapped up a quick 7-mile mountain bike ride in DuPont today. The air was definitely smoky from the wildfires happening across South Carolina. You could *see* the haze hanging in the trees, but I didn't spot any active fires nearby.

All the trails I rode were still open. It felt good to stretch the legs and get a little ride in.

Stay safe out there and [check local alerts](https://markforchange.com/tours/2025-03-27-wildfires-sc-volunteer-tablerock/) if you're planning a trip.
