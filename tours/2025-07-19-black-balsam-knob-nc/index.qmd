Darya and I hit the trails at **Black Balsam Knob** in North Carolina, and wow - this place is incredible! 

**Easy hike, amazing views.** The trail is accessible for most fitness levels, but the payoff is absolutely stunning. Panoramic mountain views that stretch for miles in every direction.

This entire area is pretty awesome. The Appalachian Mountains really show off here, and you can see why it's such a popular spot for hikers and photographers.

Perfect day out with Darya exploring some of North Carolina's best hiking. Already planning our next adventure in this area!
