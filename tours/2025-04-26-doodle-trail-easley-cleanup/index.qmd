On a cloudy but beautiful Saturday, a  group of volunteers came together to clean up the Doodle Trail in Easley, SC. We gathered under the gizibo, handed out gear — vests, grabbers, gloves, and green trash bags — and set off to make a difference.

The turnout was better than expected, with families and kids all pitching in to help! A big thank you to Darya Diminitiyanova for putting this together and the Girl Scouts + Leaders.

## A Day of Hard Work and Good Spirits

Headed out with trash pickers and their motivation, we spread out along the trail, picking up everything from plastic bottles to paper, to empty beer cans hidden in the bushes.

The Doodle Trail, usually a peaceful path connecting Easley and Pickens, was definitely showing signs of litter build-up inside the wooded areas.

At the end of the morning, we gathered back at the gizibo to take a group photo with our haul of six bags of trash. It felt good to see the community put in some hard work for a cleaner trail. 

I met some really cool poeple along the way.
