What a wonderful day we had with the whole crew together - **Sister Jackie**, my girlfriend, and all the kids for a fall adventure at **Sky Top Orchard** in Flat Rock, NC.

**Apple picking was fantastic.** The orchard had excellent varieties to choose from, and the kids enjoyed filling up their bags. Sky Top Orchard runs a great operation with friendly staff and beautiful mountain views surrounding the property.

After loading up on fresh apples, we headed over to **Bent Creek** for a family-friendly hike. The trails were perfect for the kids, and we enjoyed some beautiful nature together.

A perfect day combining family time, outdoor adventure, and supporting local agriculture. Already planning our next orchard visit.
