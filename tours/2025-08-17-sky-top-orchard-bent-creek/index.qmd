What an amazing day! We had the whole crew together - **Sister Jackie**, my girlfriend, and all the kids for a perfect fall adventure at **Sky Top Orchard** in Flat Rock, NC.

**Apple picking was a blast!** The orchard had incredible varieties to choose from, and the kids had so much fun filling up their bags. Sky Top Orchard is such a well-run operation with friendly staff and beautiful mountain views surrounding the property.

After loading up on fresh apples, we headed over to **Bent Creek** for a nice family-friendly hike. The trails were perfect for the kids, and we got to enjoy some beautiful nature together.

Perfect day combining family time, outdoor adventure, and supporting local agriculture. Already planning our next orchard visit!
