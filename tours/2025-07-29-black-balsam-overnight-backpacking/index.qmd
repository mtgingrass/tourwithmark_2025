Back to **Black Balsam Knob**, but this time with a twist - overnight backpacking with full packs! 

**Same stunning location, totally different adventure.** When you're carrying everything you need for the night - tent, sleeping bag, food, water, and gear - even this "easy" hike becomes a real workout. But wow, is it worth it!

Camping up here is absolutely magical. The sunset views are incredible, and waking up above the clouds with 360-degree mountain vistas? Unforgettable. The night sky without light pollution is simply mind-blowing.

This area really shines for backpacking. Multiple trail options, established campsites, and those amazing panoramic views make it perfect for an overnight adventure. Just remember to pack layers - it gets COLD up here at night, even in summer!

Nothing beats earning these views with a heavy pack and then enjoying them from your tent door in the morning. Already planning the next overnight trip!
