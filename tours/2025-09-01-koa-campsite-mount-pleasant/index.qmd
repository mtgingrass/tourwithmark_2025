What a weekend! Packed up the crew and headed to the KOA campsite in Mount Pleasant for some much-needed family time. My fianc√©, sister, and all our kids came along for what turned out to be an absolute blast.

The campsite had everything we could ask for - great swimming facilities where the kids spent hours splashing around while we adults kept a watchful eye from poolside with cold beers in hand. The highlight for the kids was definitely the foam party - they went absolutely wild running through mountains of bubbles, emerging looking like little snow creatures.

The best part wasn't just the activities though - it was the simple pleasure of sitting around, shooting the shit, sharing stories and laughs while the kids ran wild. These are the moments that make family camping trips so special. Already planning our next adventure!
