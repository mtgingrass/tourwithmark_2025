My bookshelf reflects my curiosity. I choose many books that explore history, politics, philosophy, and the human condition. These books challenge me to think, question assumptions, and connect dots between unrelated ideas. The more I read, the more connections I make.

I'll try to keep up with the books I have read and add them here. From this point on, I will add them in the order I read them.
