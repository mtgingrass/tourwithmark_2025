# Welcome to Tour with Mark 

## Don't just think, do.

I’m Mark, and this is my space. A place for adventure, learning, and self-reflection. I’m a thinker, a traveler, and a lifelong learner.

I don’t just think about things, I do them.  

I’ve built out my own camper van and experienced the realities of a tough life. I’ve been poor, and I’ve been comfortably middle class. I’ve been  homeless, and I’ve lived in luxury apartments that most of my peers couldn’t afford. I delivered newspapers from age 8 through 14, worked at McDonald’s and retail jobs. From there, I went on to serve as an Air Force electronics technician; eventually to managing multi-million dollar IT contracts. I’ve seen a lot—across industries, social classes, and life’s full spectrum. 

## This Site

I’ve stepped away from traditional social media; not because I don’t have opinions, but because I want to consume less. I want to focus on literature written with dedication and attention, ideas that took time to develop, perhaps over months, years, or even a lifeteim.  

Welcome.

**This is TourWithMark.com. My trail. My terms. My Life.**
