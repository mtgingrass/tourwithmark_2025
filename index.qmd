# Welcome to Tour with Mark 

## Don't just think, do.

I’m Mark, and this is my space. A place for adventure, learning, and self-reflection. I’m a thinker, a traveler, and a lifelong learner.

I don’t just think about things—I do them.  

I’ve built out my van and experienced the realities of a tough life. I’ve been poor, and I’ve been comfortably middle class. I’ve been technically homeless, and I’ve lived in luxury apartments that most of my peers couldn’t afford. My journey has taken me from delivering newspapers and working at McDonald’s and retail jobs to serving as an Air Force electronics technician and eventually managing IT contracts in the corporate world. I’ve seen a lot—across industries, social classes, and life’s full spectrum, from struggle to stability. 

## This Site

This site is where it all merges. Here, you’ll find my life experiences, the challenges from my hikes, and the philosophy behind my pursuit of a more meaningful life. I’ve stepped away from traditional social media—not because I don’t have opinions, but because I want to create more often and consume less. I want to focus on literature written with dedication and attention, ideas that took time to develop, perhaps over months, years, or even a lifeteim.  

Whether you’re here to follow my adventures, learn from my experiences, or find motivation for your own journey, welcome.

**This is TourWithMark.com. My trail. My terms. My Life.**
