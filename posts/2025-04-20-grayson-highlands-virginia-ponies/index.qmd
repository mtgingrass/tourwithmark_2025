Almost finished up a with a #vanlife trip to **Grayson Highlands, Virginia** with Daria for her birthday week. It was my first real hike post-surgery, and it felt *so* good to get back out there.

**Ollie turned into the Pony Whisperer.** Ponies were walking right up to us like he’d summoned them.

Great people on the trail, beautiful views, and we’ve still got a little more time before we head home. Feeling thankful, recharged, and already thinking about the next trail.

Happy Birthday, Darya.
